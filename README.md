# IP-Camera-Alarm-Output
Simple Python application to trigger the alarm relay output on Viewtron IP cameras.

Some Viewtron IP cameras have alarm input and alarm relay output ports. The input / output
ports can be used to integrate Viewtron IP cameras with external alarm devices. Viewtron
IP cameras have an enterprise software development API. The API uses HTTP and XML to send
and recieve messages from the IP camera.

The ManualAlarmOut() method of the API can be used to turn the alarm relay output on and off.

You can find all of the Viewtron IP cameras that have alarm input / alarm output ports here.
